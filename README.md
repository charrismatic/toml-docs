## About

[https://github.com/charrismatic/toml-docs#readme](https://github.com/charrismatic/toml-docs#readme)

Inspired by the TOML based `toml-resume` resume-generator and the JSON based `node-readme-generator` this will be a more general collection of untilities and preformatted templates that will output often required files, 
invoices, time tracking reports, business cards, new project readmes, changelogs.
